          <h2>Diving in Diani </h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Kenya has world-class dive sites all along its fabulous coastline, there are several dive schools in Diani Beach: Diving the Crab at Nomads, Diani Marine and Ocean Tribe, and all of them will take experienced divers out beyond the reef to dive with whale shark, dolphins, turtles, rays and even humpback whale depending on the time of year.

           <h2>How to Get Around Diani Beach</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              The easiest <b>way to get around Diani Beach</b> is with a tuk-tuk or an Uber. If you’ve got a local sim card, you can request a ride as soon as you land at the Ukunda Airstrip. For short trips around town, flagging down a tuk-tuk driver is your best bet. You will need to haggle the driver down to a fair price. I’d suggest asking the hotel staff and other travelers what’s a good price so you don’t get ripped off.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              The Diani Beach area is home to many sea turtles, which are now an endangered species. While there are laws in place to protect these turtles, it is still important for beachgoers to be aware of how they can help protect these creatures. Here are some tips on how to protect sea turtles while enjoying Diani Beach: -Avoid using any products that contain chemicals, such as sunscreen, that could be harmful to turtles. -Be careful not to disturb turtles while the

         <h2>Diani Ride a Camel</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              A trip to Diani isn’t complete without a camel ride along the beach. The kids love it and I’ve seen many terrified adults cling on as the camel lowers them precariously toward the ground. Pay 500 bob / 5 USD for 15 minutes – you’ll find the camel guy all along the beach as he walks the entire length throughout the day. 
                        </p>      
            <h2>Diani Go Kitesurfing </h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              When the wind picks up, you will see kite surfers all along the Diani Beach coastline. With shallow waters and consistent winds, Diani is one of the best places to kitesurf and learn to kitesurf in Kenya. Kenya is famed for its ancient shipping routes and relies heavily on the two winds, the Kusi which blows up from the south from April to September and the Kaskazi which blows over from India from December to April. Hop over to H20 Extreme at Kenya airways or Quest Kitesurfing at Diani Lodge.

            <h2>Diani Go Horse-riding</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              In the same way that the camel guy walks along the beach, you will find the ‘beach boys’ trying to offer beach rides, but for safe riding with horses that are well cared for and loved, then head to Kinondo Kwetu. You can have a lesson in the paddock, ride along the beach, or venture into the sacred Kaya Forest. Go early – the sun can be hotter than Hades – but this is wonderful thing to do in Diani beach. 
               </p>      
            <h2>Shopping in Diani Beach</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Food and drink: Heading to the supermarket may not top your list of <b>things to do in Diani, </b> but we all got to eat. Carrefour and Chandarana are the best places to shop for food and drink in Diani. Both supermarkets are big name brands in Kenya and stock many familiar brands from abroad. Souveniers: Visit the Bombolulu Workshop at Diani Beach Shopping Centre.

          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            The Salty Squid occupies a prime beachfront location at the Galu end of Diani Beach. Beautifully decorated, the best part about this restaurant is its proximity to the beach. Food is fresh and always delicious – you will love the tuna carpaccio, but they also offer a variety of tacos, burgers, Asian pork dishes, and a selection of salads or lobster, prawns.

               <h2><h2>Diani beach Climate  </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            The <b>climate in Diani Beach</b> is tropical, wet and warm. The <b>best travel time</b> is from late November to mid-March. After that it gets uncomfortably hot with increased humidity. The <b>worst travel time</b> is in the main rainy season from April to June. It usually rains only briefly and then the sun shines again, but it is also possible to suffer a continuous rain for days. Also in the 2nd rainy season, October-November, you have to reckon with inconveniences. As it is never cold on rainy days you can still sit at the pool bars or even take beach walks. Aside from the several bars and the shopping malls in Ukunda, there are no other attractions that you can visit in the rain; you can only tour Mombasa, visiting the old town, Fort Jesus, some temples, shops and shopping malls. Rainy days can be a bit boring in Diani.

          <h2>How To Get to Diani Beach</h2>
              <p style="text-align:justify; font: weight 6px;">
                There are 5+ flights daily from Nairobi to Ukunda Airstrip, which is in central Diani. Flights from Nairobi depart from Jomo Kenyatta International airport or Wilson, which is a smaller, easier airport to traverse. Return flights start from 5000 KSH or 50 USD. From Mombasa, take a taxi to Diani Beach. It takes about 90 minutes and costs approximately 5000 KSH / 50 USD. The SGR train – goes from Nairobi to Mombasa in 6 hours. It’s fast, clean and comfortable and a fraction of the price, but you will still need to pay for the taxi from Diani to Mombasa. You can drive to Diani from Nairobi. It takes about 9 hours. My advice is to head through Shimba Hills, rather than through Mombasa. It doesn’t add any time on and it is much quieter and more scenic the closest airport to us is Malindi Airport, just 45 minutes’ drive away, with frequent daily flights from Nairobi.
                 </p>
                <h2>Ukunda Airstrip? Can I also fly into Mombasa?</h2>
                  <p> 
                    Ukunda Airstrip is about 12 minutes away and easily accessible. We strongly recommend our guests to fly into Ukunda (as opposed to Mombasa). Ukunda is well served by Jambo jet and Fly540 (from JKIA) and by Safari link and Air Kenya (from Wilson). Moi international at Mombasa also offers many local and international services. When arriving to Mombasa please be aware there is a longer transfer as there is a crossing via the Likoni Ferry.
